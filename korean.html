    Korean food is a dynamic and flavorful cuisine that has gained international recognition for its rich <br>
    culinary heritage. Rooted in centuries-old traditions, Korean cuisine is characterized by its use of <br>
    fermented foods, bold spices, and a harmonious balance of flavors. From the savory depth of kimchi <br>
    to the smoky sweetness of bulgogi, Korean food offers a unique blend of tastes that reflect the <br>
    country’s diverse landscapes and cultural practices. With an emphasis on fresh ingredients and <br>
    communal dining, Korean cuisine is not only about nourishment but also about bringing people together.<br>

    </div>
    <div class="nothing">
        <p>Bibimbap, sometimes romanized as bi bim bap or bi bim bop, is a Korean rice dish. 
            The term bibim means "mixing" and bap is cooked rice. It is served as a bowl of warm 
            white rice topped with namul and gochujang. 
            Egg and sliced meat are common additions, stirred together thoroughly just before eating.
            <br>
            <br>
            Bibimbap can be various kinds of bibimbap depending on the ingredients. Vegetables commonly
             used in bibimbap include julienned oi (cucumber), aehobak (courgette/zucchini), mu (radish),
              mushrooms, doraji (bellflower root), and gim, as well as spinach, soybean sprouts, and gosari
               (bracken fern stems). Dubu (tofu), either plain or sautéed, or a leaf of lettuce may be added,
                or chicken or seafood may be substituted for beef. For visual appeal, the vegetables are often
                 placed so adjacent colors complement each other. In the South Korean version, sesame oil,
                  red pepper paste (gochujang), and sesame seeds are added.

            Japchae is a savory and slightly sweet dish of stir-fried glass noodles and vegetables that is popular in Korean cuisine.
            <br>
            <br>
            Japchae – the bright, colourful Korean noodle dish made with an abundance of vegetables,
             juicy bits of marinated beef and a sesame-forward dressing. Made with sweet potato noodles
              which have a unique slippery, chewy texture, this is sort of a stir fry, sort of a noodle salad, and 100% YUM!
            <br>
            <br>
            Japchae is a famous Korean noodle dish that I describe as sort of a stir fry, sort of a salad. It’s a cross between
             the two in my mind because stir fried vegetables are tossed with noodles and sauce in a bowl rather than on the stove,
              and served barely warm.
            <br>
            <br>
            You start by mixing the sauce in a giant bowl, then pile all the ingredients in one after the other – the noodles, a giant
             mound of cooked vegetables then lastly the seared marinated beef. Then finally, you give it a big toss to mix it all together
              in the bowl. This part is really satisfying, getting really stuck into it! (Just make sure you use a really big bowl else
               you’ll be cursing!).

            <br>
            <br>
            Spicy garlic fried chicken is a Chinese dish that was adopted by Koreans, just like
             Black Bean Noodles (Jajangmyeon) and Sweet and Sour Pork (Tangsuyuk) among other things. While
              the condiments are pretty much the same in Asian countries, what sets the Korean version apart
               is that we like it crispy even after coating the chicken in the sauce.

            Kimchi is a traditional Korean side dish consisting of salted and fermented vegetables, most often napa cabbage or Korean radish. 
            A wide selection of seasonings is used, including 
            gochugaru, spring onions, garlic, ginger, and jeotgal. Kimchi is also used in a variety of soups and stews.
            Kimchi is a staple food in Korean cuisine and is eaten as a side dish with almost every Korean meal.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are hundreds of different types of kimchi made with different vegetables as the main ingredients.
             Traditionally, winter kimchi, called gimjang, was stored in large earthenware fermentation vessels, called onggi,
              in the ground to prevent freezing during the winter months and to keep it cool enough to slow down the
               fermentation process during summer months. The vessels are also kept outdoors in special terraces
                called jangdokdae. In contemporary times, household kimchi refrigerators are more commonly used.

        <p>Sundubu-jjigae is a jjigae in Korean cuisine. The dish is made with freshly curdled extra soft tofu which has not been strained and 
            pressed, vegetables, sometimes mushrooms, onion, optional seafood, optional meat, and gochujang or gochugaru.
            The dish is assembled and cooked directly in the serving vessel, which is traditionally made of thick, robust porcelain, but
             can also be ground out of solid stone. A raw egg can be put in the jjigae just before serving, and the dish is delivered
              while bubbling vigorously. It is typically eaten with a bowl of cooked white rice and several banchan.
            <br>
            <br>
            Extra soft tofu, called sundubu in Korean, is softer than other types of tofu and is usually sold in tubes.
             The first iteration of sundubu was discovered by a Joseon civil official who used spring water and sea 
             water during its cooking process. The stew has multiple variations from various counties in South Korea.

            Tteokbokki, or simmered rice cake, is a popular Korean food made from small-sized garae-tteok called tteokmyeon or 
            commonly tteokbokki-tteok. Eomuk, boiled eggs, and scallions are some common ingredients paired with tteokbokki in dishes.
            It can be seasoned with either spicy gochujang (chili paste) or non-spicy ganjang (soy sauce)-based sauce; the former is 
            the most common form, while the latter is less common and sometimes called gungjung-tteokbokki (royal court tteokbokki). 
            <br>
            <br>
            Today, variations also include curry-tteokbokki, cream sauce-tteokbokki, jajang-tteokbokki, seafood-tteokbokki, rose-tteokbokki,
             galbi-tteokbokki and so on. Tteokbokki is commonly purchased and eaten at bunsikjip (snack bars) as well as pojangmacha
              (street stalls). There are also dedicated restaurants for tteokbokki, where it is referred to as jeukseok tteokbokki
               (impromptu tteokbokki). It is also a popular home dish, as the garae-tteok can be purchased in pre-packaged, semi-dehydrated form.

        <p>Bulgogi is a gui made of thin, marinated slices of meat, most commonly beef, grilled on a barbecue or on a stove-top griddle. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin and rib eye are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish.
            Bulgogi is a very popular dish in South Korea, where it can be found anywhere from upscale restaurants to local supermarkets as pan-ready kits.

            Samgyeopsal, samgyeopsal-gui, or grilled pork belly is a type of gui in Korean cuisine. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Thick, fatty slices of pork belly, sometimes with the skin left on and sometimes scored
             on the diagonal, are grilled on a slanted metal griddle or a gridiron at the diners' table,
              inset with charcoal grills or convex gas burners. Usually, diners grill the meat themselves,
               flipping and cutting them with tongs and scissors, and eat directly from the grill.

        <p>Kimchi-jjigae or kimchi stew is a jjigae, or stew-like Korean dish, made with kimchi and other ingredients, such as pork, scallions, onions, and diced tofu. It is one of the most common stews in Korean cuisine.
            <br>
            <br>
            Kimchi's flavor as an ingredient becomes stronger and more complex as it ages.
             As a result, kimchi-jjigae is often cooked using older, more fermented, and "riper" kimchi,
              which has a much more pronounced flavor and contains higher amounts of probiotics.
               (Living bacteria in fresh, uncooked kimchi will not survive the cooking process.)
                As kimchi is the core ingredient in kimchi-jjigae, other ingredients are dependent on personal preference.

            Gimbap, also romanized as kimbap, is a Korean dish made from cooked rice, vegetables, fish, and meat rolled in gim—dried sheets of seaweed—and served in bite-sized slices. The origins of gimbap are debated.
            Some sources suggest it originates from Japanese norimaki, introduced during Japanese colonial rule,
             while others argue it is a modernized version of bokssam from the Joseon era.
              The dish is often part of a packed meal, or dosirak, to be eaten at picnics and outdoor events,
               and can serve as a light lunch along with danmuji (yellow pickled radish) and kimchi.
                It is a popular takeaway food in South Korea and abroad[7] and is known as a convenient food because of its portability.
